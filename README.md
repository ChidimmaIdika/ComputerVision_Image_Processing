## Introduction
Computer Vision is a fascinating field of artificial intelligence that grants machines the ability to perceive, understand, and interpret the visual world. It is all about giving machines the ability to see and process images in a way that resembles human vision. This project delves into image processing and basic computer vision tasks using Python libraries like NumPy, Pillow, and OpenCV.

## Project Overview
In this project, I explored the following key aspects of computer vision and image processing:    

- **Loading and Displaying Images:**   
   This project covers the process of loading and displaying images using Python libraries like NumPy, Matplotlib, and Pillow.   
- **Image Filtering:**   
   Image filtering techniques are demonstrated, allowing users to extract specific features from images by filtering by color channels (Red, Green, Blue).   
- **Image Manipulation:**   
   Users can learn how to manipulate images, including resizing, rotating, and applying filters. This project includes examples of converting images to grayscale.   
- **Creating an Image Canvas:**   
   This project provides guidance on generating blank canvases and programmatically drawing shapes such as rectangles, circles, and more, allowing for custom image creation.   
- **Creating a Traffic Light:**   
    An example illustrates the process of creating a simple traffic light using OpenCV to draw the red, yellow, and green lights.   

These aspects collectively offer a foundational understanding of basic image processing and computer vision tasks using Python libraries and tools.

## Installation
To get started with this project, make sure to install the necessary dependencies.    
You can install the required Python libraries using Conda by running:   *conda install Pillow*
